# Term assignment: Product management front-end web application for the Bluevelvet Music Store

New users can register themselves.

## What the students neeed to do in this assignment?

- Use vanilla CSS (no library of framework allowed) to style all the HTML pages created for the user stories described in the sequence of this README file.

- In addition to the details provided in this README.md file, the student must take a look at all the files located in the frontend directory of this repository looking for comments with addiional tips and instructions for this assignment.

## Technologies Used (frontend)

- HTML
- Vanilla CSS (without CSS libraries such as BootStrap pr TailWind)
- JavaScript (without libraries\frameworks such as vue or React)
