# Product management front-end web application for the Bluevelvet Music Store
A product management front-end web application made using Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.   

This application is used in the course Web Programming, taught by Rodrigo Martins Pagliares and Fellipe Guilherme Rey de Souza at the undergraduate Computer Science course at UNIFAL-MG - Brazil.

You can try the the webapplication without configuring the backend and a MySQL database. The front-end is self-contained and can be used to perform simple CRUD operations on products table upon logging in. The data is stored and retrieved from LocalStorage. New users can register themselves.

## What the students neeed to do in this assignment?

- Use vanilla CSS (no library of framework allowed) to style all the HTML pages created for the user stories described in the sequence of this README file.
- Use the JavaScript LocalStorage API to simulate back-end persistence in the frontend.
